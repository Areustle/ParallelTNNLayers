# Input      |  Filter (actually fK C fH fW, but C taken from Input)
# Here the first 4 entries are the NCHW shape of the Input tensor, followed by
# the number of cells to zero-pad (along the H&W dimensions). Then the filter
# tensor shape where channel depth is implied by C and the tensor rank.
#
# N: Input data batch size
# C: Shared channel depth of input and filter tensors
# H: Input tensor height
# W: Input tensor width
# pad: depth of cells to zero-pad along HW border of input
#
# fK: Output channel depth after convolution.
# fH: filter height of convolution kernel
# fW: filter width of convolution kernel
# fRank: The rank of the tensor decomposition.
